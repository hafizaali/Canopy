 <h1>Explore with Canopy</h1>
 <h2> Join us at one of our monthly excursions to parks, botanical gardens and anywhere where the wild things grow...</h2>
 <p>The trips are varied and fun, because Canopy believes in bringing like-minded individuals together in an interactive and plant filled inspired way. As we are a UK organization our trips are arranged from various cities within the UK, but they tend to start and end in London. This doesn't mean you can't join if you're living in Manchester, just shoot us an email and hop in your car! As we are recognized by the UK government as part of the Environmental Preservation Committee, we also receive great group discounts!

 If you are at a loose end on December 2nd 2018, why not join us as we explore Christmas at KEW (insert link).  Thereâ€™s also a chance to hit the local pub. Check out our Facebook event to see who else is going! We love arranging car pools.</p>
